This is the homepage of me, m0rph. I'm a security generalist with experience on both the red and blue sides of security. Specifically I have experience in the fields of penetration testing, web application security, adversary emulation, purple teams (see: [What's a purple team?](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-purple-teaming-in-cybersecurity)), security infrastructure and operations, incident response, and phishing/vishing campaigns. I currently work as an information security consultant.
