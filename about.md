This is the homepage of m0rph. I'm a security consultant who specializes in network penetration testing. I also do web & mobile application security, Bluetooth Low Energy, and RFID/NFC. Additionally I've dabbled in reverse engineering, as well as some hardware. Thoughts and opionions are my own, not reflective of any employer.
