### **About**

This is the homepage of me, m0rph. I'm a security generalist with experience on both the red and blue sides of security. Specifically I have experience in the fields of penetration testing, web application security, adversary emulation, purple teams, security infrastructure and operations, incident response, and internal awareness phishing campaigns. I currently work as an information security consultant.

### **Languages I know**

- Python2/3
- C/C++
- Intel/AT&T/MIPS x86 assembly
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- mySQL/MSSQL/MariaDB
- *Objective-C[^bignote]*
- *Swift 4[^bignote]*

[^bignote]: I'm still learning this language.

### **Books**

The only thing I like more than being at a computer is reading about one. My favorite books are listed here:

### **Reading List**

Essential papers I recommend reading:

1. "Winnti: More than just a game" Kaspersky Labs, 2013 [1](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)

### **APT**

#### **APT groups**

As an avid red teamer and someone working in adversary emulation, I'm particularly interested in state sponsored hacking groups. These groups are frequently termed "Advance Persistent Threat" (APT) groups. From [Fireeye's](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/advanced-persistent-threats-apts) website, "Like other attackers, APT groups try to steal data, disrupt operations or destroy infrastructure. Unlike most cyber criminals, APT attackers pursue their objectives over months or years. They adapt to cyber defenses and frequently retarget the same victim."

APT groups are frequently (but not always) government funded, and this adaptability and gradual timeline are a result of calculated, measured, and sophisticated cyber threat campaigns. As expected, some of the most devastating hacks can come from APT groups, and this is the reason adversary emulation is becoming increasingly important. It is critical to know how your infrastructure measures up to your potential enemies' attack methods.
